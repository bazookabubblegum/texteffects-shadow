	<p>
		If Life was not Constantly Convexing and Concaving
		<br />
		Lungs would not expand and collapse.
		<br />
		Dreams would not Unravel and Fade
		<br />
		Time Itself would be a matter of improbablity rather than relebance and response
		<br />
		The trees would be lost in waves of freedom not spoken to their roots. The seasons they go through would be unconnected and it would deliniate them from the acceptance of change, because it would be abdnormal stimuli.
		<br />
		<br />
		Just as all things in nature build and change, so does the space and fortitude of our minds and how that clicks with the external and the internal.
		<br />
		The Microcosm and the Macrocosm.
		<br />
		That ever flowing circle we symbolize with so well.
